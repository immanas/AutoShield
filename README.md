# 🛡️ AutoShield – Real-Time AWS Resource Exposure Monitor & Alert System

AutoShield is like a digital security guard for your AWS cloud . AutoShield is a **serverless cloud security monitoring system** built on core AWS services. It detects critical misconfigurations like public S3 buckets, open EC2 ports, or overly permissive IAM policies in **real time**, alerts administrators via email using SNS, and logs violations into DynamoDB for future analysis and dashboarding.

Designed for **DevSecOps**, **Cloud Engineers**, and **Security Teams**, AutoShield helps prevent accidental data leaks and compliance violations in dynamic cloud environments.

## 🚨 Real-World Risks Addressed 

| ⚠️ Misconfiguration      | 🔍 What Can Go Wrong                                                   |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Public S3 Bucket**     | Customer data or proprietary code exposed to the internet              |
| **Open EC2 Port (22/3389)** | Remote server access, brute-force attacks, and lateral movement       |
| **Unrestricted IAM Policy** | Privilege escalation and full-account compromise                     |
| **Unencrypted RDS/EBS**  | Sensitive database content exposed without encryption at rest          |

### 🛡️ Why AutoShield? — Key Features & Their Purpose  

| 🚀 Feature | 📝 Description | 🎯 Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Real-Time Security Auditing** | AutoShield continuously listens for misconfiguration events (like public S3 buckets) via EventBridge. | Enables proactive detection instead of manual, delayed audits — increasing security posture. |
| **Serverless Architecture** | Built entirely on AWS Lambda, EventBridge, and DynamoDB with no servers to manage. | Ensures scalability, cost-efficiency, and minimal maintenance for continuous monitoring. |
| **DynamoDB-Powered Log Storage** | Misconfiguration findings are stored in a DynamoDB table. | Offers fast, scalable, and queryable access to historical security logs for audit/troubleshooting. |
| **DynbDashboard (Live Insights)** | A frontend dashboard displays logged events in real-time. | Provides immediate visibility and context for security teams or developers — no need to check logs manually. |
| **IAM + X-Ray + CloudWatch Integration** | IAM roles ensure least-privilege access, X-Ray helps trace execution, and CloudWatch tracks logs and alerts. | Guarantees end-to-end observability, traceability, and secure operations in production. |
| **S3 Misconfiguration Detection** | Specifically targets one of the most common AWS security risks: public S3 buckets. | Solves a real-world cloud security problem that leads to data leaks and compliance failures. |
| **EventBridge-Based Triggering** | Uses AWS EventBridge rules to trigger Lambda when relevant AWS events occur (e.g., S3 policy change). | Ensures instant response to misconfigurations — no delay or batch processing. |
